# EquationSolver
C++ class for solving expressions and equations with single-instance variables.

### Disclaimer
This is not production-worthy code! View this simply as a proof-of-concept. Preconditions are implicit. No error checking exists.

Additionally, I wrote this when very young (this was actually my first comprehensive C++ program). As a result, I was very uneducated about styling and data structures. This is evident in the fact that I used arrays (which I called stacks) to mimic the behavior of a binary tree. Why didn't I just use a binary tree? Fantastic question. That is what I am going to do now. This is in the process of being completely re-written.
